# Interview

undefined -
A variable that has not been assigned a value

function -
A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

array -
a data structure that stores a collection of related data items in contiguous memory locations.

object -
An object is a collection of properties

hoisting -
the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope – all before code execution

scoping -
the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript

promises -
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation

let, var, const
Use const for variables that you don't intend to change.
Use let for variables that you need to re-assign.
Avoid using var in modern JavaScript development, as let and const offer better scoping and prevent unexpected behavior.

prototypes
A prototype is an existing inbuilt functionality in JavaScript.

Classes
Classes are a template for creating objects

# event loop

this keyword -
refers to the object that is currently executing or calling the function

Closures
A closure is formed when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function's variables and parameters

Debouncing
Debouncing is a technique that prevents unnecessary function executions by controlling when a function is called.

Throttling
the process of limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a certain period.

HTTP Response Codes
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:
Informational responses (100–199),
Successful responses (200–299),
Redirects (300–399),
Client errors (400–499),
Server errors (500–599).
200 - OK
201 - Created
202 - Accepted
404 - Not Found
405 - Method Not allowed
408 - Request Timed out
500 - Internal Server Error
503 - Service unavailable

HTTP Headers
HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value. Whitespace before the value is ignored.
HTTP Request Methods
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

GET - The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

POST - The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

PUT - The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

DELETE The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
